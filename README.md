I'm a research scientist with a CS engineering background. Experienced PhD Data Scientist working in Health Industry for Government agencies.

My research focussed on the design of statistical indicies for classification and clustering geographic areas with similar demographic and socioeconomic charateristics. An open source tool is available in this repo : 
- [homogeneity and location index](https://github.com/lpinzari/homogeneity-location-index).
- [Mapping Network flow in R and Arcgis](https://github.com/lpinzari/mapping-networks-r-arcgis)

The following link includes conferences, publication and presentation of the project: [SA3 Browser: A Tool for classification and comparison of geographic areas](https://www.ludovicopinzari.net/portfolio.html).

Learning and sharing knowledge are the best component of my personality. In this gitHub account you find personal notes and tutorials on various topics:
- [SQL & PostgreSql](https://github.com/lpinzari/sql-psql-udy) 
- [Git & GitHub](https://github.com/lpinzari/git-github-udy) 
- [Unix Shell](https://github.com/lpinzari/unix-shell-udy)
- [Data structures & Algorithms in Python](https://github.com/lpinzari/udacity-dsa-nand)
- ... Many more to come 😄 **Knowledge shared** = **Knowledge**<sup>2</sup>
